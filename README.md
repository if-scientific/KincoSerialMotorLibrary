# KincoSerialLibrary
This is the repository that houses the code for KincoSerialMotorLibrary on Nuget.

The code is meant to be minimal. It covers the needed communication to and from the serial port (RS232). Most of the registers, values, and addresses are in there. 

Please feel free to create pull requests, if you find anything that needs to be changed.
